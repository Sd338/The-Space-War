## Why I Created This Game

I created **The Space War** as a fun project to experiment with game development. Although my main focus is AI development, I wanted to try something new and explore the world of game creation. This project was a way to challenge myself by combining skills in game mechanics, animation, and user interaction. It was a refreshing break from AI development, allowing me to learn and experiment in a new domain!
